This one's been a long time in the making, but today we’re excited to ship our second major update to the site. Here’s a rundown of what’s new:

## Friends

Part of our mission at PeakBucket is to enable our <a href="http://www.peakbucket.com/users" target="_parent">users</a> to share their <a href="https://peakbucket.com/faq#what-is-an-activity" target="_parent">activity</a> the way they want. To further this goal, we've added friendships. We opted to implement a friend/unfriend paradigm (as opposed to a follow/unfollow one) for a few reasons:

* **Private Users:** One in three PeakBucket users are <a href="https://peakbucket.com/faq#how-private-profiles-work" target="_parent">private</a>. Friendships give these users the option to selectively share their activity with friends.

* **Features:** Friendships provide an unlock for a number of features on our roadmap:

  * Users can now tag friends as companions on their activities.

  * Users who are tagged as a companion in a friend's activity can now <a href="https://peakbucket.com/faq#copying-activities" target="_parent">copy</a> it to their <a href="https://peakbucket.com/faq#how-profile-works" target="_parent">profile</a> (vs. adding it themselves).

  * There are more friendship-related features in the works, so stay tuned!
